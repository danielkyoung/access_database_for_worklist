Add a “global” module (Standard Module) in Access

A “global module” in Access is a Standard Module. Code in a standard module isn’t tied to any one form/report, and its Public procedures/functions can be called from anywhere (forms, reports, queries, macros, other modules).

Steps (Access VBA editor):

Open the VBA editor: Alt + F11

In the Project pane, select your database project (e.g., VBAProject (YourDb.accdb))

Go to Insert → Module

A new module appears under Modules (e.g., Module1)

In the Properties window (F4), rename it to something meaningful (e.g., modGlobals, modUtilities)

Example:

' In a standard module: modUtilities
Public Function CleanText(ByVal s As Variant) As String
    CleanText = Trim(Nz(s, ""))
End Function

Public Sub LogMessage(ByVal msg As String)
    Debug.Print Now & " - " & msg
End Sub


Now you can call:

From a form: Me.txtBox = CleanText(Me.txtBox)

From a query expression: CleanText([SomeField]) (must be a Public Function)

From anywhere in VBA: LogMessage "Hello"

Add a module specific to a form (Form Module / Class Module)

Each form already has its own module behind the form (a class module). This is where event procedures live: Form_Load, button click handlers, etc.

To open a form’s module:

In the Navigation Pane, right-click the form → Design View

Click View Code (or press Alt + F11, then in the form design: View → Code)

You’ll see code like:

Private Sub cmdSave_Click()
    ' Runs when user clicks the button on THIS form
End Sub


You can also add general helper routines there, but they are scoped like any other class module.

How they differ (what matters in practice)
1) Scope / accessibility

Standard module (global):

Public Function/Sub is callable from anywhere.

Great for shared utilities, business rules, constants, generic routines.

Form module (specific):

Private members are usable only inside that form.

Public members exist, but you must call them through an instance of the form (and the form may need to be open).

Example:

' In Form_frmOrders module
Public Sub RecalcTotals()
    ' ...
End Sub


Call from elsewhere:

Forms!frmOrders.RecalcTotals   ' only works if frmOrders is open

2) Object context (Me)

Form module: Me refers to the current form instance (super convenient).

Standard module: no Me (unless you pass a form reference in).

3) Event handling

Form module: natural home for events (Form_Load, control clicks, etc.).

Standard module: no form events; you call into it from event procedures.

4) Best-practice division of labor

Put UI/event glue in the form module (responding to clicks, updating controls).

Put reusable logic in standard modules (validation, calculations, DB helper functions).
